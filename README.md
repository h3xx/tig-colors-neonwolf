# Neonwolf Colorscheme for [Tig](https://github.com/jonas/tig)

This is a high-contrast, dark colorscheme for [tig](https://github.com/jonas/tig) that was inspired by the badwolf series of color schemes.

![sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h3xx/tig-colors-neonwolf/master/screenshots/sample.png)

## Installation

Include it as part of your `~/.tigrc` file.

    $ mkdir -p ~/.tig
    $ cp tig-colors-neonwolf-256.tigrc ~/.tig
    $ echo 'source ~/.tig/tig-colors-neonwolf-256.tigrc' >>~/.tigrc

Or if you're particularly lazy:

    $ cat tig-colors-neonwolf-256.tigrc >>~/.tigrc
